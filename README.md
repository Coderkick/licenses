    *The code only needs to be published in case of edits to the original software. Derivative work does not need to be open-source.

    <h3>CDKL-Lite</h3>
    The <b>CDKL-Lite</b> is a condition-free license, lighter than both the CDKL and the Apache but arguably stronger than the MIT, written to be used as the terms for most of the <a href="https://docs.coderkick.com/History#Paperboat">ex-Paperboat</a>'s internal open-source software, and now used as Coderkick's main license if not stated otherwise. It protects the code and its author while allowing users to run the software, with any modification, without worries.
